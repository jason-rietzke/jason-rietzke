### About Me

Even in my early childhood, I was fascinated by tech and started programming at 12. Since then I have had a strong interest in development and got regularly sidetracked by 3D-Printing, Microcontrollers, and such topics â€“ Computer Science became my passion.

I taught programming myself, primarily with iOS development using Swift. In this time I developed numerous Apps and published two of them. Especially SwiftUI took my attention and I find the declarative approach very interesting.

With growing experience, I got more into software engineering and shifted my focus toward conceptualizing and designing systems. 
Currently, I'm primarily working on the development of Symbolic-AI at [LiveReader](https://github.com/livereader) for the Notitia project.
