## Hey üëã

I'm Jason and I'm a computer science major. I love programming and delving into scientific topics.

### About Me

Even in my early childhood, I was fascinated by tech and started programming with 12. Since then I have had a strong interest in the development and got regularly sidetracked by 3D-Printing, Microcontrollers, and such topics ‚Äì Computer Science became my passion.

I taught programming myself, primarily with iOS development using Swift. In this time I developed numerous Apps and published two of them. Especially SwiftUI took my attention and I find the declarative approach very interesting.

With growing experience, I got more and more into software engineering and shifted my focus more towards conceptualize and designing systems. I am recently very much into artificial intelligence, and at [LiveReader](https://github.com/livereader) I am primarily concerned with the development of Symbolic-AI and I am very interested in expanding my knowledge in this very exciting area even further. Neural networks, GANs and NLP are definitely on my to-do list üìù.


### My Projects

I develop services and applications for a wide variety of purposes and many different programming languages. Most of them are private or corporate projects, but I would like to increase the number of open source projects in the future, as I really like the basic idea of sharing knowledge üôÇ.

Playing around with microcontrollers like Arduino & Co is also one of my passions. Building my own SmartHome Accessories with them is a lot of fun for me.
