### Hey, I'm Jason (aka. LamaCap)

I like programming and scientific topics in general. I often develop Apps for iOS in Swift and I love using SwiftUI.

<br>

#### About Me

I develop services and applications for a wide variety of purposes and in a variety of programming languages.
I am a huge fan of Swift though, especially the new SwiftUI Framework.
Lots of my projects are private or internal company projects. Because of that they are not publicly accessible and can not be published on GitHub.

However, I want to spread more here and will try to make more of my work accessible.

Also I work with microcontrollers from time to time and like build my own SmartHome Accessories. 
I also like to play with the Twitch API and try out some of the features it offers.
These are some of the topic I like to play around with in my spare time.
