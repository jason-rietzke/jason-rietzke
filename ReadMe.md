# ðŸ‘‹ Hey

## About Me

Hi, Iâ€™m Jasonâ€”a software engineer with a focus on system development and a fascination for building efficient, reliable software.
I started with programming at an early age and have since honed my skills across various technologies and languages.

Currently, Iâ€™m the Head of Development at [LiveReader], where I work on Symbolic-AI for the [Notitia] platform as well as on Speech-Processing for the [Alternis] project.
My day-to-day involves designing systems, solving complex technical challenges, and ensuring our projects are scalable and maintainable.

Iâ€™ve worked with multiple programming languages throughout my career, and recently, Iâ€™ve been diving deeper into Rust.
Its focus on safety and performance has been both challenging and rewarding, aligning well with my commitment to creating robust systems.

## What Iâ€™m Into

-   **System Development**: Architecting and building scalable solutions for modern challenges.
-   **Programming**: Constantly exploring new languages and paradigmsâ€”Rust has been particularly exciting lately.
-   **Artificial Intelligence**: Pushing the boundaries of symbolic reasoning and intelligent systems.
-   **Hands-On Tech**: I love experimenting with hardware, microcontrollers, and emerging tech.

## My Open Source Work

Iâ€™m passionate about contributing to the open-source community and have developed the [Graphly D3](https://github.com/livereader/graphly-d3) libraryâ€”a powerful tool for creating interactive, data-driven graph visualizations using D3.js. Itâ€™s designed to simplify the process of building complex visualizations for web applications.

Looking ahead, Iâ€™m eager to expand my involvement in open-source projects, collaborate with other developers, and share more tools and ideas with the community.
